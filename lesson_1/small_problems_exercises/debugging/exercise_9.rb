# April 20, 2025      Number Guessing Game

# A friend of yours wrote a number guessing game. The first version he shows you picks a random number between 1 and a provided maximum number and offers you a given number of attempts to guess it. However, when you try it, you notice that it's not working as expected. Run the code and observe its behavior. Can you figure out what is wrong?

# def valid_integer?(string)
#   string.to_i.to_s == string
# end

# def guess_number(max_number, max_attempts)
#   winning_number = (1..max_number).to_a.sample
#   attempts = 0

#   loop do
#     attempts += 1
#     break if attempts > max_attempts

#     input = nil
#     until valid_integer?(input)
#       print 'Make a guess: '
#       input = gets.chomp
#     end

#     guess = input.to_i

#     if guess == winning_number
#       puts 'Yes! You win.'
#     else
#       puts 'Nope. Too small.' if guess < winning_number
#       puts 'Nope. Too big.'   if guess > winning_number

#       # Try again:
#       guess_number(max_number, max_attempts)
#     end
#   end
# end

# guess_number(10, 3)

# ANSWER: 

# The guess_number invocation on line 32 of the original code is invoking our method again from the beginning, which resets our attempts variable to 0 and also generates a new winning number, which are the two things causing issues in our code. To fix this, we can get rid of the guess_number invocation. We must also add a break statement if the winning number has been guessed. 

# SOLUTION: 

def valid_integer?(string)
  string.to_i.to_s == string
end

def guess_number(max_number, max_attempts)
  winning_number = (1..max_number).to_a.sample
  attempts = 0

  loop do
    attempts += 1
    break if attempts > max_attempts

    input = nil
    until valid_integer?(input)
      print 'Make a guess: '
      input = gets.chomp
    end

    guess = input.to_i

    if guess == winning_number
      puts 'Yes! You win.'
      break
    else
      puts 'Nope. Too small.' if guess < winning_number
      puts 'Nope. Too big.'   if guess > winning_number
    end
  end
end
