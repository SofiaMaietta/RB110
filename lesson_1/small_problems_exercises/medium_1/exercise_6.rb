# April 19, 2025      Stack Machine Interpretation 

# Write a method that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming language that has the following commands:

# n  - Place a value n in the "register". Do not modify the stack.
# PUSH - Push the register value on to the stack. Leave the value in the register.
# ADD - Pops a value from the stack and adds it to the register value, storing the result in the register.
# SUB - Pops a value from the stack and subtracts it from the register value, storing the result in the register.
# MULT - Pops a value from the stack and multiplies it by the register value, storing the result in the register.
# DIV - Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value, storing the integer result in the register.
# MOD - Pops a value from the stack and divides it into the register value, storing the integer remainder of the division in the register.
# POP - Remove the topmost item from the stack and place in register
# PRINT - Print the register value

# All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and MOD).Programs will be supplied to your language method via a string passed in as an argument. Your program may assume that all programs are correct programs; that is, they won't do anything like try to pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they won't contain unknown tokens.

# You should initialize the register to 0.
